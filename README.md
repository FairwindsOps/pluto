This is a very simple utility to help users find deprecated Kubernetes apiVersions in their code repositories and their helm releases.

## Purpose

Kubernetes sometimes deprecates apiVersions. Most notably, a large number of deprecations happened in the [1.16 release](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2019/07/18/api-deprecations-in-1-16/). This is fine, and it's a fairly easy thing to deal with. However, it can be difficult to find all the places where you might have used a version that will be deprecated in your next upgrade.

You might think, "I'll just ask the api-server to tell me!", but this is fraught with danger. If you ask the api-server to give you `deployments.v1.apps`, and the deployment was deployed as `deployments.v1beta1.extensions`, the api-server will quite happily convert the api version and return a manifest with `apps/v1`. This is fairly well outlined in the discussion in [this issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/58131#issuecomment-356823588).

So, long story short, finding the places where you have deployed a deprecated apiVersion can be challenging. This is where `pluto` comes in. You can use pluto to check a couple different places where you might have placed a deprecated version:
* Infrastructure-as-Code repos: Pluto can check both static manifests and Helm charts for deprecated apiVersions
* Live Helm releases: Pluto can check both Helm 2 and Helm 3 releases running in your cluster for deprecated apiVersions

## Installation

### asdf

We have an asdf plugin [here](https://github.com/FairwindsOps/asdf-pluto). You can install with:

```
asdf plugin-add pluto
asdf list-all pluto
asdf install pluto <latest version>
```

### Binary

Install the binary from our [releases](https://github.com/FairwindsOps/pluto/releases) page.

### Homebrew Tap

```
brew install FairwindsOps/tap/pluto
```

## QuickStart

First, follow the install instructions to install pluto.

### File Detection in a Directory

Run `pluto detect-files -d <DIRECTORY YOU WANT TO SCAN>`

You should see an output something like:

```
$ pluto detect-files -d pkg/finder/testdata
KIND         VERSION              DEPRECATED   FILE
Deployment   extensions/v1beta1   true         pkg/finder/testdata/deployment-extensions-v1beta1.json
Deployment   extensions/v1beta1   true         pkg/finder/testdata/deployment-extensions-v1beta1.yaml
```

This indicates that we have two files in our directory that have deprecated apiVersions. This will need to be fixed prior to a 1.16 upgrade.

### Helm Detection (in-cluster)

```
$ pluto detect-helm --helm-version 3
KIND          VERSION        DEPRECATED   RESOURCE NAME
StatefulSet   apps/v1beta1   true         audit-dashboard-prod-rabbitmq-ha
```

This indicates that the StatefulSet audit-dashboard-prod-rabbitmq-ha was deployed with apps/v1beta1 which is deprecated in 1.16

You can also use Pluto with helm 2:

```
$ pluto detect-helm --helm-version=2 -A
KIND         VERSION              DEPRECATED   RESOURCE NAME
Deployment   extensions/v1beta1   true         invincible-zebu-metrics-server
Deployment   apps/v1              false        lunging-bat-metrics-server
```

### Helm Chart Checking (local files)

You can run `helm template <chart-dir> | pluto detect --show-all -`

This will output something like so:

```
KIND         VERSION   DEPRECATED   RESOURCE NAME
Deployment   apps/v1   false        RELEASE-NAME-goldilocks-controller
Deployment   apps/v1   false        RELEASE-NAME-goldilocks-dashboard
```
