# Orb

CircleCI has introduced the concept of reusable config in the form of [Orbs](https://circleci.com/orbs/).  As of pluto v5.1, Fairwinds publishes an orb called [`fairwinds/pluto`](https://circleci.com/orbs/registry/orb/fairwinds/pluto) in order to provide easier configuration inside of CircleCI.
